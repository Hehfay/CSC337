First solve the 1D heat equation in serial as discussed. Plot the results for a
reasonable spacial resolution. Tool your code to stop when the heat profile has
come close enough to equilibration (choose a tolerance).

Then generalize to 2D. (Make a backup of your 1D code first, of course.)
Start with the analogous boundary conditions and initial conditions.
When it is working, change the initial condition to be some interesting initial
heat distribution in the spirit of the illustration on the Wikipedia page for
the heat equation.
